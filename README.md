# RESUME
Here is some info about my education :)

I am a 4th-year student at SPbSUE in the direction of production management. I have been studying Python and Data Science since September 2020. In parallel with my studies, I work as a climbing coach. I really like rock&ice climbing, alpine skiing and team computer games like cs or dota.

HARD SKILLS:
1) Python (great) , mySQL (good) and PostgreSQL (normal);
2) NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, matplotlib and some other relevante libraries;
3) Basic machine learning algorithms such as linear and logistic regression, decision trees, cluster analysis;
4) TensorFlow (normal), Keras (good);
5) Technical English (B1-B2);
6) Linear algebra (good), mathematical analysis (good), statistics (good), probability theory (normal);

I have no experience in IT due to my studies. However, I have taken part in some programming contests on codeforces and all cups and also have trained on Kaggle training datasets. The internship or work as a junior developer are a great chance for me to gain experience on real data.
