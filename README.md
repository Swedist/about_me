# RESUME
Here is some info about me and my education :)

I have graduated from St. Petersburg State University of Economics (SPbSUE) with a degree in production management. I have been studying date science field since September 2020. Now I work as data scientist. In my work I am engaged in the following works:
1) write an effective, readable code;
2) realize ETL pipeline through orchestration platforms;
3) EDA;
4) Work with BigData;
5) Solving classification, clustering and regression problems;
6) A/B testing;

Also while working ds I have taken part in some programming contests on codeforces and all cups that were focused on text analysis, scoring. In parallel with my studies, sometimes I work as a climbing coach. I really like rock&ice climbing, alpine skiing and team computer games like cs :)
