1) write an effective, readable code;
2) realize ETL pipeline through orchestration platforms;
3) EDA;
4) Work with BigData;
5) Solving data-science problems;
6) Linear programming;
7) A/B testing;

Also while working data-scientist I have taken part in some programming contests on codeforces and all cups that were focused on text analysis, scoring. I really like rock&ice climbing, alpine skiing and team computer games like cs :)
