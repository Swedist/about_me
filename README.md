# RESUME
Here is some info about my education :)

I am a 4th-year student at SPbSUE in the direction of production management. I have been studying Python and Data Science since September 2020. In parallel with my studies, I work as a climbing coach. I really like rock&ice climbing, alpine skiing and team computer games like cs or dota.

HARD SKILLS:
1) Python (great), SQL (cool), VSCode, Git, Docker;
2) NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, matplotlib and some other relevante libraries;
3) Basic machine learning algorithms such as linear and logistic regression, decision trees, cluster analysis, TimeSeriesAnalys, Random Forest, Boosting algorithms;
4) NLP, ;
4) Technical English (B1-B2);
5) Linear algebra (5), mathematical analysis (5), statistics (5), probability theory (4);

I have some experience in IT. I have some EDA skills, I have worked with Time Series Analysis, using Prophet, XGBoost, Exponenstial Smoothing and so on. I have taken part in some programming contests on codeforces and all cups and also have trained on Kaggle training datasets. The work as a junior ds are a great chance for me to gain more experience on real data. Hope get some feedback :)
